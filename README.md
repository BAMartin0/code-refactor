# code-refactor

## Built as a first project to refactor existing code that allows review of semantic elements, knowing where and when to use them, placing alt attributes, consolidating CSS styling while updating HTML class, and lastly producing a detailed README.

## First, refactor HTML code so that it uses semantic elements only. Second, add alt attributes to describe the photos on the deployed site for readability. Next, consolidate CSS file by combining like code ensuring that the HTML code reflects. Lastly, create README file detailing the process. ![]( c:/Users/DevBr/bootcamp/UR-VIRT-FSF-PT-02-2024-U-LOLC/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Develop/assets/images/Screenshot 2024-03-04 230236.png)
